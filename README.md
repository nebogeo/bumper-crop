== Bumper Crop ==

Bumper Crop is a social impact board game based on the experiences and
challenges of being a small holding farmer in India. This digital
prototype of the game was created by a team of UK/India academic
researchers and practitioners working in partnership with the New
Delhi-based non-profit organisation Digital Green as part of the Arts
Humanities Research Council research project Play to Grow: Augmenting
Agriculture with Social Impact Games. The project explored and tested
the use of computer games as a method of storytelling and learning to
engage urban users in complexities of rural development, agricultural
practices and issues facing farmers in India. A paper version of the
physical platform of the game, project reports, and conference papers
produced through the project are all available to download from the
project website: http://www.playtogrow.org
